# FFA Squirrels Cube

**180 cards | 3-Player Grid Draft | Fast & Aggressive FFA Multiplayer**

Built from existing collection for Aaron (Squirrels), Austin (Ninjas), Eric (Wizards), and everyone (LOTR flavor).

## Stats
- **85 creatures** - Aggressive creature density
- **37 lands** (30 fixing duals + 2 rainbow + 5 LOTR utility) - Excellent mana base
- **14 hybrid cards** - Maximum draft flexibility
- **16 multicolor cards** - Reward color commitment

## Design Goals
- **Fast games**: 30-40 minutes, aggressive curve, minimal life totals (20)
- **FFA scaling**: "Each opponent" cards, multiple threats, political gameplay
- **3-player Grid Draft**: 15 rounds × 12 cards (pick + replace, pick, pick)
- **High complexity, fast reads**: No shuffling, transforms, or excessive counters

## Philosophy
Prioritize cards that:
- Scale in multiplayer (damage/triggers per opponent)
- Read quickly (no wall of text)
- Create immediate board presence
- Support tribal themes (Squirrels, Ninjas, Wizards, LOTR)

**Token Policy**: Squirrel, Goblin, Orc Army, Food, Clue, Treasure only
**Counter Policy**: +1/+1 counters and loyalty counters only

**Mana Base**: 30 dual land fixers + 2 rainbow lands (City of Brass, Mana Confluence) + 5 LOTR utility lands (Barad-dûr, Mount Doom, Minas Tirith, The Shire, Rivendell)
**Colors**: Balanced ~20-23 cards per color + strong hybrid/multicolor support
