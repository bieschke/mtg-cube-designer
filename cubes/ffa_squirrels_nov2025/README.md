## Draft Format: 3-Player Grid Draft

**Setup**: 15 rounds √ó 12 cards per round = 180 cards total

**Each Round**:
1. Lay out 9 cards in a 3√ó3 grid
2. **Player 1**: Picks a row or column (3 cards), then **replaces** them with 3 new cards
3. **Player 2**: Picks a row or column (3 cards), **no replace**
4. **Player 3**: Picks a row or column (3 cards)
5. Shuffle remaining 3 cards back into deck

**Result**: Each player drafts 45 cards

## Game Format: Free-for-All Multiplayer

- **Target**: 3 games in ~3 hours (30-40 min per game)
- **Deck construction**: 40-card decks from 45-card draft pool
- **Multiplayer rules**: Standard FFA (last player standing wins)

## Card Choices & Rationale

### FFA Scaling Cards (High Priority)
Cards that say "each opponent" are 2-3x value in FFA:
- **Sulfuric Vortex** - 4 damage per turn cycle (2 per opponent)
- **Gray Merchant of Asphodel** - Double drain
- **Guttersnipe** - 4 damage per spell
- **Atarka's Command** - Double burn/pump
- **Siege Rhino** - Double drain
- **Fanatic of Mogis** - Double burn
- **Torbran** - Amplifies ALL red damage to opponents
- **Braids, Arisen Nightmare** - Triggers per opponent
- **Gandalf the Grey** - 3 damage to EACH opponent

### The One Ring & Answers
- **The One Ring**: Indestructible, needs exile not destroy
- **Answers**: Cast Into Fire, Anguished Unmaking, Fractured Identity, Mount Doom

### Mana Base Philosophy
- **30 dual land fixers** - Excellent 2-color support
- **2 rainbow lands** (City of Brass, Mana Confluence) - 3-color support
- **4 LOTR utility lands** - Flavor + utility (Barad-d√ªr, Mount Doom, Minas Tirith, The Shire)
- **All enter untapped** (except utility lands) - Fast games priority

### Hybrid Cards (Draft Flexibility)
- Deathrite Shaman, Burning-Tree Emissary, Dryad Militant
- Fulminator Mage, Judge's Familiar, Manamorphose
- Nightveil Specter, Rakdos Cackler, Vault Skirge

### LOTR Flavor Package
- **Creatures**: Gandalf the Grey, Gandalf White Rider, Gandalf the White, Frodo Determined Hero, Gollum Scheming Guide
- **Equipment**: The One Ring, Sting, Glamdring
- **Spells**: Flame of Anor, Gandalf's Sanction, Cast Into Fire

## Session Notes

### What Worked Well
- **Hybrid card focus** - Great for Grid Draft flexibility
- **FFA scaling priority** - Sulfuric Vortex, Guttersnipe, Gray Merchant overperform
- **Personal themes** - Squirrels, Ninjas, Wizards add character
- **Fast reads** - No shuffling/transforms keeps games moving
- **Strong mana base** - 30+ fixers supports multicolor strategies

### Cards We Debated
- **Steel Leaf Champion** - Loved the card but GGG too restrictive (CUT)
- **Gollum Scheming Guide** - Cute but low impact (KEPT for flavor)
- **All UR cards** - Loved them all, kept 9 UR cards!
- **Delver of Secrets** - Double-sided so excluded (would have been great)

### Learnings for Next Time
- Start with hybrid cards early - they're the best for Grid Draft
- Build mana base earlier in process
- Track color balance throughout (don't wait until end)
- "Each opponent" effects are GOLD in FFA
