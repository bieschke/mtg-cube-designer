# The Blitz Cube v2

**135 cards | 2-player Grid Draft | Hybrid & Modal Focus**

The Blitz Cube returns with ultra-strict constraints and a focus on hybrid mana flexibility. Built for fast, interactive games with maximum decision-making and minimal bookkeeping.

## Stats
- **135 cards total**
- **17 hybrid/split cards** for flexible casting
- **12 modal spells** (Commands, Charms, split cards)
- **6 phyrexian mana cards** for bluffing potential
- **28 dual lands + 4 mana rocks**
- **CMC avg: ~1.8** (ultra-low curve)

## Design Goals
- **Speed:** Games end in 5-8 turns
- **Clean:** No tokens, counters, shuffling, or flipping
- **Flexible:** Hybrid mana reduces color commitment in grid draft
- **Interactive:** Modal spells create decisions every game
- **Low text:** Simple cards, no reading novels

## Philosophy

**Version 2 Evolution:**
- Stricter constraints (added: no tokens, no shuffling)
- Hybrid/modal focus for grid draft flexibility
- More decision points, less raw aggro
- Phyrexian mana creates bluffing moments

**Why Hybrid for Grid Draft:**
- Less color commitment = safer early picks
- {R/G}{R/G} and {W/B}{W/B} work in multiple decks
- Phyrexian mana ({R/P}) = castable in ANY deck
- Split cards = two spells in one

**Core Strategy:**
- Aggressive creatures backed by modal interaction
- Every spell creates a choice (Charm, Command, or split)
- Fast mana (Burning-Tree Emissary, Manamorphose)
- Flexible answers (Abrupt Decay, Wear // Tear, Fire // Ice)

**Mana Base:**
- 10 pain lands (Adarkar Wastes cycle)
- 10 check lands (Clifftop Retreat cycle)
- 8 utility duals (Spirebluff Canal, Snarls, Estuary)
- 4 colorless rocks (Sol Ring, Arcane Signet, Mind Stone, Dimir Signet)

**Colors:**
- Balanced at 20/20/20/23/19 (W/U/B/R/G)
- Red slightly favored for reach
- Every color pair has hybrid/modal support

## Signature Cards
- **Deathrite Shaman** - {B/G} utility engine
- **Snapcaster Mage** - Skill-testing flashback
- **Burning-Tree Emissary** - Mana-positive creature
- **Kolaghan's Command** - 4 modes, always relevant
- **Gut Shot** - Free removal, pure bluffing
- **Wear // Tear** - Modal answer to artifacts/enchantments
- **Bloodbraid Elf** - Cascade value
- **Thalia, Guardian of Thraben** - Taxing effect

## Constraints
✅ **YES:**
- Hybrid mana ({R/G}, {W/U}, {B/P})
- Split cards (Fire // Ice, Wear // Tear)
- Modal spells (Commands, Charms)
- Adventure cards (if simple - but we skipped for complexity)

❌ **NO:**
- Tokens (no Young Pyromancer, Lingering Souls)
- Counters (no +1/+1, loyalty, charge counters)
- Shuffling (no fetchlands, no Birthing Pod)
- Flipping/transforming (no Delver, no werewolves)
- Watermarks (aesthetic preference)

## Shopping List
- **$6.87** for 21 core cards (modal spells, charms, hybrid creatures)
- Focus on clean printings without watermarks
- Fills gaps in hybrid/modal coverage
