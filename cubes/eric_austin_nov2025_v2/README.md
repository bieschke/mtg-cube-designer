# [Cube Name TBD]
## Eric & Austin November 2025 - Version 2

**Date:** October 24, 2025
**Players:** Eric & Austin
**Format:** 2-player Grid Draft
**Size:** 135 cards
**Goal:** Ultra-clean Magic - no fiddly mechanics

## Design Parameters

### Hard Constraints (ULTRA-STRICT)
- ❌ **No tokens** (no creature tokens, blood tokens, treasure tokens, etc.)
- ❌ **No +1/+1 counters or dice tracking** (no planeswalkers, no evolve, no modular, etc.)
- ❌ **No shuffling** (no fetchlands, no tutors, no Sakura-Tribe Elder, etc.)
- ❌ **No flip/transform cards** (no Delver of Secrets, no double-faced cards)
- ❌ **No excessive text** (Austin said "ugh so much reading" - keep it simple)

### Design Goals
- ✅ Fast games (5-7 turns ideal)
- ✅ Multiple games per draft (goal: 3 games in ~30-40 min)
- ✅ Quick drafting (want to do 2-3 drafts in one night)
- ✅ Simple, clear cards (keywords > paragraphs)
- ✅ Aggressive strategies prioritized
- ✅ All 5 colors supported

### Differences from "The Blitz Cube"
This is an even MORE streamlined version with stricter constraints:
- No token generators (eliminates ~10 cards from v1)
- No shuffle effects (eliminates ramp that searches libraries)
- Focus on pure combat, direct damage, and simple removal

## Cube Structure

**Total: 135 cards**
- **28 dual lands** (all fast for aggro - NO FETCHLANDS)
- **4 mana rocks** (Sol Ring, Arcane Signet, Mind Stone, Dimir Signet)
- **~103 spells** (creatures, removal, tricks)
- **Basics:** Unlimited supply on the side (not counted in 135)
