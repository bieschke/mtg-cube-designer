# shopping list: cube v2 upgrades (hybrid & modal focus)

**Current Cube:** Built from existing collection (no tokens/counters/shuffling)
**Upgrade Goal:** Maximize hybrid mana flexibility and modal decision-making
**Budget:** $50

---

## Philosophy: Flexibility Through Hybrid & Modal Cards

This cube now emphasizes **hybrid mana** and **split/modal spells** for maximum flexibility in 2-player grid draft:

- **Hybrid cards** = castable in multiple color combinations (less commitment risk)
- **Modal spells** = create decisions every time you cast them
- **Split cards** = two spells in one, pure value
- **Phyrexian mana** = bluffing potential with 0 mana open

**Why this matters for grid draft:**
- Less color commitment = more flexibility in draft
- Modal choices = rewards skilled play
- Hybrid works in multiple decks = always playable
